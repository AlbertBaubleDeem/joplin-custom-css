# K.C.'s custom styles for Joplin

Inspired by [Devon's repo](https://github.com/devonzuegel/joplin-custom-css) I've created my own style for Joplin. It's nothing fancy, but should work with all dark themes.
In the future I might add specific styles for other themes.

I've also added a [`sample.md`](sample.md) markdown file, which I used for testing the css.
